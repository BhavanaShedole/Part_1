First Application: Shazam 

Link of the Application:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android&hl=en

Application Type:  Entertainment


History of the application 
[1] Initially when I came across this application, I felt this is something new and had rarely heard about it but then when I started to gather information I came across a fact that Chris Barton, Philip Inghelbrecht, Avery Wang and Dhiraj Mukherjee developed this application 19 years ago during the year 1999. The application was released in 2002 only in UK. People then did not have smartphones or I must say some of them did not have phone at all. To access the features of this app user’s dial 2580, hold their cellphones near the music and then receive a text message regarding the name and artist of the track. There were some other features as well which were all paid. As and when the years passed by, the application developed gradually with not much changes though. 

Finally, now the application has come up with unique features, attractive UI, which makes it very much user friendly and unique from the other musical apps.  	
Shazam has three major features Auto Shazam, Shazam camera and Tap to Shazam. 

Tap to Shazam
Tap to Shazam is just a tap on the screen of the application which then starts listening to the music playing around you , recognizes the song and displays the name of the song, the name of the artist, the video of the song and some similar suggestions as well.

Auto Shazam
 Auto shazam is the most interesting feature of this application. Selecting Auto Shazam feature of the app makes it sniff continuously for the music.  The moment it comes across any song playing around, it will display the name of the song in the notification. You can just click on the notification clear it off and then the app again continues to do its task unless you turn off the Auto Shazam. All the songs it recognizes from the surroundings it displays them in “My Shazam” of the application. 

Shazam Camera
Shazam Camera is the newly added feature to the application to implement Augmented Reality. Once you scan the shazam logo the app takes you to the world map allowing you to discover Shazam around the world that is discovering the music from all over the world. You can select any place on the moving world and then the Shazam brings to you top 10 songs from that state. For more information on the augmented reality implemented using Shazam camera, I request you to go through the video mentioned in the references. [2]

 Shazam also has a page called discover where it displays all its updates, it has its own playlists, it gives some recommendations. Then we also have My Shazam where it allows you to create your own account with Shazam. The songs recognized by the tap shazam feature of the app are saved in your account. 
Therefore, I feel the application is very much different with all the latest features when compared to other music apps. 



Drawback in the application
The only drawback I felt about the application is, it has a lot of advertisements interrupting and to get rid of this we need to upgrade to the paid version of the application.

Areas of improvement
 I feel the application should have some documentation on Shazam Camera. I feel this can be a considered as a point of improvement in the application.

First Heuristic Evaluation: Visibility of System Status
Visibility of system status means the application should inform the user about what is going on with the application. The Shazam app does follow the rule of system status visibility. Whenever we tap on the Shazam app screen it clearly tells the user that it is listening to the music playing around in your background. Similarly, when you turn on the Auto Shazam feature of the app it appears in the notification that the app is active and listening to the music in the background and unless you turn it off it still stays in the notification. The app clearly tells the user about what operation it is performing.




Second Heuristics Evaluation: Match between the system and the real world
For the application to be user friendly, it is always important that the user understands the language being used by the application or spoken by the application. Shazam app not language specific all the wording used are in English, which we can say, is a worldwide-accepted language. Though the function, features, instructions, settings everything in the app is in English, the app recognizes music of all different kinds of languages. The database of the application is again not language specific and it has a wide range of collection of songs of different languages.

Second Application: Paytm

Link of Application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.one97.paytm&hl=en

Application Type:  E-Payment, E-Commerce Application

Paytm is an Indian E-Payment, E-Commerce application developed in 2010 by Vijay Shekhar Sharma.  The application is available for all the platforms. Sooner it was announced that, Paytm had become India’s first application to cross 100 million downloads on google play store. 

Features of the application
Paytm has many features, it was the only application, which included everything mobile recharges, TV recharge, tickets booking, shopping, paytm wallet, QR code to receive and transfer amount. The application helps the users in a variety of ways. This application allows you to pay all your bills, book all your tickets like movie tickets, international flight tickets, local transportation tickets, amusement park. They also have a shopping facility which includes everything electronics, men’s fashion, women’s fashion, daily needs, utilities and they mostly have deals, offers on everything. The application slowly added many more features. The users can opt for loans as they provide multiple options foe lenders. The users also have an option to donate to the devotional places online. The application slowly started introducing many new features that made it unique. The app is provides facility to apply for Life Insurance as well. With the help of this app, we could even avail government facilities like gas connection. They are known to deal with gold.
Finally, the application played a major role when demonetization came into picture in India. This application was very much useful to implement digitization across the country when people, ATM machines, banks were in short of the new notes. The application provided the concept of QR code, which is made available in every shop, tolls on the highway, restaurants, street foods, every small place. We just had to keep money in paytm wallet, scan the QR code provided the shop owner and the money transfers immediately. Even today, people feel very comfortable to take care of their daily expenses, needs using this app.
Another interesting feature of this application they own a online bank, where people can open a zero fee account, initiate fixed deposit, or even initiate small savings. 
The application can also be useful to help you find if there are any restaurants, gas stations, hospitals, tuitions/classes, fitness/beauty center, shopping center, grocery shops, many more nearby to your place.

There are two other options, which are unique, paytm automatic and postpaid paytm.  If you enable the feature, paytm automatic the application will pay your bills automatically for the ones you want to pay every month. It will fetch the bill details and pay the bill through your paytm wallet. It also asks you to recharge your paytm wallet once the amount goes below a certain minimum balance. 
Postpaid paytm is just like our postpaid mobile connections. However, to implement this facility to the users in an authorized manner they have taken help from a known bank ICICI. So before opting this feature you will be asked to fill up your details and then the application pays on your behalf. You will have to repay it after a month without any interest. They have multiple options in this feature. 

Advantages/Drawback
The application is very useful and worthy. It does have some flaws, as the UI is not attractive, it does have adds popping up. I would conclude saying this application is apt and has all the features to fulfill the needs and requirements to a very good extent though it is a kind of unattractive.

Areas of Improvement 
I feel the UI of the application can be improved to some extent. Making the application add-free could 

First Heuristic Evaluation: Consistency and Standards
Consistency and Standards means across the application the UI designed should look uniform. While the user moves from one page to another there should not be, much difference in UI or the user should not feel he/she is into a complete new view. In Paytm application we are dealing only with bill processing, booking tickets and many more in which for every click we are directed from one view to another so it is very important that each view looks similar. I strongly feel the application has successfully implemented this heuristic.


Second Heuristics Evaluation: Help and documentation
Help and support should always be a part of any application we develop. Paytm is real time transaction processing application, every transaction we deal with some amount. Before we try to experiment with any unknown or new feature of the application it is always better to have some knowledge of that feature. Paytm application also provides help or support on the transactions you have already done. It helps you resolve issues with incomplete transactions as well. They also provide 24/7 call center facility for any emergency issues. This I feel is very much required in this type of application as we are dealing with some amount of funds.
